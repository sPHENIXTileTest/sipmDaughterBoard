# SiPM Daughter Board

This board connects the SiPM unit to the rj45 jacks, which connect to the caen breakout board, which connects the caen DT5702 unit.

[More information about the caen DT5702 unit maybe found here.](http://www.caen.it/jsp/Template2/CaenProd.jsp?idmod=1040&parent=10)

The wires on the SiPM Light blockers are 2mm pins.
